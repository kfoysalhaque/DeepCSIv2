# DeepCSIv2
This is the implementation of the INFOCOM 25 Workshop's (DeepWireless 25) paper-- DeepCSIv2:[Radio Fingerprinting of Wi-Fi Devices Through
MIMO Compressed Channel Feedback](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11152893)


<br/>

### We present DeepCSIv2, a data-driven radio fingerprinting (RFP) algorithm to characterize Wi-Fi devices acting as stations (STAs) at the physical layer. DeepCSIv2 is based on a neural network architecture that automatically extracts the STA’s radio fingerprint from the feedback captured over the air and identifies the device.
